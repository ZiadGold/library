This way, the Kirkuk TMA controller may clear the aircraft direct to the respective initial approach fix (IAF), or clear them direct to a specific waypoint for holding - as coordinated with Erbil Tower.

Aircraft that are cleared for approach via these waypoints can join these approaches at 6,000ft.</p> <p>The two ILS Y approaches both start from the same waypoint - LAVEN, located 13nm southwest of ERBIL. After LAVEN, aircraft follow the 13 DME Arc from RER to the respective final approach courses. Aircraft performing this approach from LAVEN can be cleared to LAVEN at 8,000ft, to then descend via the procedure. Because of this, it can be useful for aircraft to already be flying direct to LAVEN as assigned by Kirkuk TMA before being switched to Erbil Tower.</p> <p>The two RNP approaches have 3 IAFs each - located on each respective base and one on an extended final (see charts for more information). These can be useful as these have charted minimum altitudes from IAFs and can be useful for terrain avoidance purposes. For example, when runway 18 is in use, aircraft can be cleared direct to ARAZO and be assigned 8,500ft, then be cleared for the RNP approach from ARAZO.</p>"},{"location":"aerodrome/Baghdad/erbilIntlAirport%28ORER%29/#533-holding-procedures","title":"5.3.3.

IFR Arrivals","text":"<p>IFR arrivals are transferred to Sulaimaniyah Tower from Kirkuk TMA at 7,000ft or 8,000ft, following either the ERBIL1, ERBIL2, KIRKK1, KIRKK2 arrivals. These arrivals are similar to their counterpart SIDs, as they also have altitude restrictions of 11,000ft at waypoints PUTRI and RASKI. As such, IFR arrivals are not permitted to descend below 11,000ft until they are at least 10nm from the airport. The idea is for the aircraft to fly overhead SUL VOR to start a published ILS or VOR approach procedure. It is strongly recommended for Kirkuk TMA/Baghdad Control to coordinate with Sulaimaniyah Tower in advance on which specific approach aircraft shall be assigned for inbound aircraft. In addition to the 4 STARs and published ILS and VOR approaches, there are RNP approaches available for both runway 13 and 31. These have 3 IAFs each. See the published approach charts for more info. Kirkuk Approach may clear aircraft direct to any of these initial approach fixes instead of routing them via the STAR to start the approach. Aircraft can be cleared direct the IAF and be given the minimum descent altitude for that IAF, and can then descend via the procedure, assuring terrain separation. This can be especially useful for arrivals from the east, as they can be cleared direct to e.g. XADIL (IAF for RNP RWY13) and can remain at 13,000ft before starting the approach.

Published holding patterns are available at SUL (these are different depending on the runway in use) and is the main holding pattern for the ILS and VOR approaches. Published holding patterns are also available at TAKVA and DESKU for the RNP RWY13 and at KARUX and ALVEX for the RNP runway 31. Caution must be exercised in regards to terrain directly east of Sulaimaniyah, but also to its west, as the airport and the approach and departure paths are located in a valley between two mountains.
