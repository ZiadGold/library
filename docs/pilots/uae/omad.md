Al Bateen Executive Airport is an international airport dedicated to business jets, situated 6.5 nautical miles southeast of central Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Located on Abu Dhabi Island, the airport also hosts aviation assets belonging to the UAE government. Originally opened in 1970 as Abu Dhabi International Airport (not to be confused with the current Zayed International Airport, which was also once known as Abu Dhabi International Airport), it replaced the cityâ€™s former airport.
