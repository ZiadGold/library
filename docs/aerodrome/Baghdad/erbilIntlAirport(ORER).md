# 5. Erbil Intl Airport (ORER)
## 5.1. Particular

### 5.1.1. Aerodrome Description
Erbil International Airport is a popular international airport in Iraq. It is an important destination, in particular for the Kurdistan region and serves multiple flights. Notably, it is surrounded by mountainous terrain to its east and Erbil airport controllers face an extra challenge, as the airport is fully non-radar and procedural below 8,000ft due to lack of radar facilities.

## 5.2. General Aerodrome procedures
Erbil does not have any SMC or GMP positions and the aerodrome is fully controlled by the ADC position “Erbil Tower” (ORER_TWR), which is responsible for all aerodrome and runway movements, in addition to movements in the Erbil CTR, which extends to 13nm around Erbil, from the surface to 6,000ft.

### 5.2.1. Preferential Runway System
The preferential runway for both departures and arrivals is runway 18 and shall be used when the tailwind component is less than 8 knots.

### 5.2.2. IFR Procedures
All departures are assigned an IFR clearance with an omni-directional departure. IFR departures always file the Erbil VOR (RER) as their first waypoint in the clearance, followed by a direct to one of the following waypoints to join their flight-planned route:

* EMIDO (North)
* ROXOP (North)
* DAVAS (East)
* TOTAM (South)
* UMESA (West/Southwest)

As is the procedure for all IFR departures in Iraq, ADC (ORER_TWR) needs to get a release for departure from the overlying TMA control, ORKK_APP, in addition to departure instructions for the heading and initial climb to maintain after departure. In this regard, special consideration shall be given due to terrain to the east of the airport, and due to a lack of radar below 8,000ft, making Erbil a non-radar procedural airspace below 8,000ft.

## 5.3. Procedures for airborne aircraft
In addition to aircraft on the ground at Erbil, Erbil Tower is also responsible for airborne arrivals and departures at and below 6,000ft. Not much is known about how the procedural airspace at Erbil operates. As such, ATC shall use their discretion with these aircraft. Special caution must be taken due to terrain to the east of the airport. As is the procedure at procedural airports, due to the lack of radar, only one aircraft must operate in the non-radar procedural airspace at one time.

### 5.3.1. IFR Departures
By default, IFR departures shall be assigned a climb to 6,000ft before being transferred to the overlying Kirkuk TMA controller. However, this assigned climb level can be higher if prior coordination is made with Kirkuk TMA, so long as radio-telephony communication of the aircraft is transferred before/when they pass 6,000ft. Due to the problem of having terrain to the east of the airport, a suggestion for the departure procedure is to let aircraft maintain runway heading until passing around 5,500ft (the MSA in the surrounding region), before being cleared direct to their first waypoint. Caution must be exercised with departures exiting via DAVAS and TOTAM, as they are located southeast of Erbil and are close to terrain. As with initial climbs, procedures for the routing of specific departures can be coordinated with Kirkuk TMA to ensure safety and an efficient flow of traffic.

### 5.3.2. IFR Arrivals
IFR arrivals are transferred to Erbil Tower from Kirkuk TMA at 7,000ft or 8,000ft. It is strongly recommended for Kirkuk TMA/Baghdad Control to coordinate with Erbil Tower in advance on which specific approach aircraft shall be assigned for inbound aircraft. This way, the Kirkuk TMA controller may clear the aircraft direct to the respective initial approach fix (IAF), or clear them direct to a specific waypoint for holding - as coordinated with Erbil Tower. The following published approach procedures are available at Erbil:

* ILS Z RWY18
* ILS Y RWY18
* ILS Z RWY36
* ILS Y RWY36
* RNP RWY18
* RNP RWY36

The ILS Z approaches have initial approach fixes on the final leg of both runways, both 20nm from the RER VOR (GAZNA for RWY18 and GAWAN for runway 36). Aircraft that are cleared for approach via these waypoints can join these approaches at 6,000ft.

The two ILS Y approaches both start from the same waypoint - LAVEN, located 13nm southwest of ERBIL. After LAVEN, aircraft follow the 13 DME Arc from RER to the respective final approach courses. Aircraft performing this approach from LAVEN can be cleared to LAVEN at 8,000ft, to then descend via the procedure. Because of this, it can be useful for aircraft to already be flying direct to LAVEN as assigned by Kirkuk TMA before being switched to Erbil Tower.

The two RNP approaches have 3 IAFs each - located on each respective base and one on an extended final (see charts for more information). These can be useful as these have charted minimum altitudes from IAFs and can be useful for terrain avoidance purposes. For example, when runway 18 is in use, aircraft can be cleared direct to ARAZO and be assigned 8,500ft, then be cleared for the RNP approach from ARAZO.

### 5.3.3. Holding procedures
Only one IFR arrival must be present in Erbil airspace at or below 6,000 feet. Further arrivals must hold as published at published holding patterns at respective initial approach fixes, until the leading aircraft has fully landed at Erbil, or until an Erbil departure has passed 6,000 feet, and separation has been assured between the two aircraft. Published holding patterns are available at GAZNA (IAF for ILS Z RWY18), GAWAN (IAF for ILS Z RWY36), ZIBAR (IF for ILS Y RWY18) and RONAK (IF for ILS Y RWY36). A manual holding instruction can also be given, e.g. over RER. Once again, caution must be exercised in regards to terrain to the west of RER. Published holding patterns also exist for go-around procedures, in case of go-arounds and can be used in extraordinary circumstances.
