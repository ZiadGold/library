# 8. Sulaimaniyah Intl Airport (ORSU)
## 8.1. Particulars

### 8.1.1. Aerodrome Description
Sulaimaniyah International Airport is an airport located east of Kirkuk. As with Erbil, it is a procedural non-radar airport below 8,000ft, however it has conventional SIDs and STARs for easier operation of the procedural airport.

## 8.2. General Aerodrome procedures
Sulaimaniyah airport is a procedural non-radar airport. It only has one aerodrome position - the ADC position (ORSU_TWR). In addition to controlling all aerodrome and runway movements, the position also controls the surrounding Sulaimaniyah CTR which is 5nm around Sulaymaniyah airport, extending from the surface to 6,000ft.

### 8.2.1. Preferential Runway System.
The preferential runway is runway 32, as it has a published ILS approach procedure, unlike runway 14.

### 8.2.2. IFR Procedures
All departures are assigned an IFR clearance with an omni-directional departure. IFR departures always file the Sulaimaniyah VOR (SUL) as their first waypoint in the clearance, followed by a direct to one of the following waypoints to join their flight-planned route:

* TOMSI (North)
* BOXIX (East)
* SOBIL (East/South)
* MUTAG (Southwest/West)

As is the procedure for all IFR departures in Iraq, ADC (ORSU_TWR) needs to get a release for departure from the overlying TMA control, ORKK_APP, in addition to departure instructions for the heading and initial climb to maintain after departure.

## 8.3. Procedures for airborne aircraft
In addition to aircraft on the ground at Sulaimaniyah, (ORSU_TWR) is also responsible for airborne arrivals and departures at and below 6,000ft. As is the procedure at procedural airports, due to the lack of radar, only one aircraft must operate in the non-radar procedural airspace at one time.

### 8.3.1. IFR Departures
All IFR departures are assigned either SIDs respective to the active runway in use that either fly to “ERBIL” or “KIRKUK”. As such, the ERBIL1, ERBIL2, KIRKK1 and KIRKK2 are the available departures. The departure shall be assigned based on the departure waypoint, based on which of these two waypoints is closest to the aircraft’s flight planned route. The SID is designed to allow aircraft to pass the waypoints PUTRI or RASKI, both located 10nm from SUL, at or above 11,000ft, to avoid terrain to the west and shall be transferred to Kirkuk TMA when passing 6,000ft.

### 8.3.2. IFR Arrivals
IFR arrivals are transferred to Sulaimaniyah Tower from Kirkuk TMA at 7,000ft or 8,000ft, following either the ERBIL1, ERBIL2, KIRKK1, KIRKK2 arrivals. These arrivals are similar to their counterpart SIDs, as they also have altitude restrictions of 11,000ft at waypoints PUTRI and RASKI. As such, IFR arrivals are not permitted to descend below 11,000ft until they are at least 10nm from the airport. The idea is for the aircraft to fly overhead SUL VOR to start a published ILS or VOR approach procedure. It is strongly recommended for Kirkuk TMA/Baghdad Control to coordinate with Sulaimaniyah Tower in advance on which specific approach aircraft shall be assigned for inbound aircraft. In addition to the 4 STARs and published ILS and VOR approaches, there are RNP approaches available for both runway 13 and 31. These have 3 IAFs each. See the published approach charts for more info. Kirkuk Approach may clear aircraft direct to any of these initial approach fixes instead of routing them via the STAR to start the approach. Aircraft can be cleared direct the IAF and be given the minimum descent altitude for that IAF, and can then descend via the procedure, assuring terrain separation. This can be especially useful for arrivals from the east, as they can be cleared direct to e.g. XADIL (IAF for RNP RWY13) and can remain at 13,000ft before starting the approach. This shall be coordinated with ORSU_TWR.    

### 8.3.3. Holding procedures
Only one IFR arrival must be present in Sulaimaniyah airspace at or below 6,000 feet. Further arrivals must hold as published at published holding patterns at respective initial approach fixes, until the leading aircraft has fully landed at Sulaimaniyah, or until a Sulaimaniyah departure has passed 6,000 feet, and separation has been assured between the two aircraft. Published holding patterns are available at SUL (these are different depending on the runway in use) and is the main holding pattern for the ILS and VOR approaches. Published holding patterns are also available at TAKVA and DESKU for the RNP RWY13 and at KARUX and ALVEX for the RNP runway 31. Caution must be exercised in regards to terrain directly east of Sulaimaniyah, but also to its west, as the airport and the approach and departure paths are located in a valley between two mountains. Published holding patterns also exist for go-around procedures, in case of go-arounds and can be used in extraordinary circumstances.
