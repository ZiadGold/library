## 7.2. General Aerodrome procedures
Mosul airport is closed in real life. When controlling aircraft in Mosul, ATC is advised to use their own discretion. The airport used to have an SMC position (ORBM_GND) and an ADC position (ORBM_TWR) which controlled the Mosul CTR which was positioned 5 nautical miles around Mosul airport and from the surface to 4,000ft. The overlying TMA is Kirkuk TMA, controlled by ORKK_APP.

All departures are assigned an IFR clearance with an omni-directional departure. As is the procedure for all IFR departures in Iraq, ADC (ORBM_TWR) needs to get a release for departure from ORKK_APP, in addition to departure instructions for the heading and initial climb to maintain after departure
